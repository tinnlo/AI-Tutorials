      "### April 17, 2024 - A Sharp High and Quick Decline\n",
      "- On April 17, Nvidia's stock hit its monthly high but faced a sharp decline right after. This could potentially be tied to market reactions to news events, earnings forecasts or external economic factors that need to be looked into for a more detailed understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "### April 19, 2024 - A Dramatic Drop\n",
      "- The most notable movement was on April 19, when the stock plummeted by more than 10% in a single day. Factors such as disappointing earnings reports, market instability, or negative news specific to the tech industry could have contributed to this dramatic fall.\n",
